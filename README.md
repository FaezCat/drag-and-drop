## Drag and Drop TS

This is a simple drag and drop project to practice using both the TypeScript language and OOP when interacting with the DOM.

If you wish to clone this repo and try it for yourself, simply use 'npm i' to install the lite-server dependency and then start your server through the 'npm start' command. By default, the server will run on localhost:3000.
